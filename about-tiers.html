There are also some easy fangames in here as well like Trio's Squabble, Angelic Altercation, and Mike's Big Showdown.  If you're looking to do full game challenges there's no heal runs of both Deltarune chapters individually.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #9900ff">Elite</h2>
            <p>This tier is a massive step up from the Master tier, being significantly more difficult and time consuming. Many challenges in this tier are a combination of many other smaller challenges that have been featured previously and because of that it's a big step up from master tier. Some examples of this are Deltarune Chapters 1+2 All Bosses No Hit, Martlet Full Fight No Hit, and Endingtale Full Fight No Hit. Other challenges from this tier include No More Deals No Hit, Keeptale No Hit, and Undertale Last Breath Phase 3 No Hit. </p>
